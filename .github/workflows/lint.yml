  # todo: fix upstream warnings; from the readme:
  # The most common cause of missing licenses seems to be workspaces that
  # don't include forward their license files. Go to the repo for the
  # workspace and copy the relevant files from there.
  # A package license may receive a confidence warning stating that
  # cargo-bundle-licenses is "unsure" or "semi" confident. This means that
  # when the found license was compared to a template license it was found to
  # have diverged in more than a few words. You should verify that the licence
  #  text is in fact correct in these cases.
  #
  # If this job fails, you probably need to regenerate the license, e.g.
  # CARGO_HOME=/tmp/dd-cargo cargo bundle-licenses --format yaml --output LICENSE-3rdparty.yml
